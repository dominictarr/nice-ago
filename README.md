# nice-ago

generate terse time representations.

takes the two largest time units, so ten seconds ago is rendered as "10s"
but a minute and a half ago is "1m30s" the yesterday morning might be "1d5h" etc,
the largest unit is a year. jumps straight from days to years because months
are not all the same size!
